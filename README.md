# TESLA LANDING PAGE | LaiaRuizM

- Hi there people! üëãüèª
- My name is Laia Ruiz Mart√≠nez and this a JavaScript's project called **Tesla landing**.

## -- About this project üìãüôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è --

- I have developed almost the same Tesla's landing website but without any functionality.
  Welcome to a project where I have had the fortune of facing new challenges and learning the Astro and Tailwind frameworks.
  Welcome on board!

### üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model-x.avif
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model-y.avif
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solar-panels.avif
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ video.webm
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Card.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HeroSection.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LandingHeader.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Logo.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ModelX.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ModelY.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Section.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SolarPanels.astro
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.astro
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### What can I find in this exercise?

> **NOTE:** In this exercise, you can find the following files and folders:

1. The folder üìÇ `src/` contains the files for this website: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and images.
1. The folders üìö `public/` and `docs/` are automatically generated when we start the project. GULP reads the files in the src/ folder, processes them, and then generates them inside the `public/` and `docs/` folders.
1. The folder üìÇ `dist/` is automatically generated when we deploy the project to Netlify's website.
1. The individual files üìù that are loose in the repository root, such as gulpfile.js, package.json... are the project configuration files and we do not need to modify them.

### How can I start from scratch?

> **NOTE:** Below are the steps to follow:

1. **Make sure you have Node JS installed / install it** to work with the Starter Kit.
1. **Create your own repository**. NOTE: Be very aware of the folder where you are at all times.
1. Download the **Adalab Starter Kit from GitHub**.
   - As a recommendation: Avoid cloning the repo, because if you do, you won't be able to add commits.
1. **Copy all the files** from the Starter kit to the root folder of your repository.
   - Remember to copy also the **hidden files** (IMPORTANT!)
   - If you decide to clone the repo, avoid copying the `.git` folder. Because, if you do, you will be overwriting your own repository.
1. **Open a terminal** in the **root** folder of your repository.
1. **Install the local dependencies** by executing the command in the terminal:

```bash
   npm install
```

1. To start a template basics execute the command in the terminal:

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template basics
```

### üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
